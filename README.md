# Sticky Notes Project

## Description

This is a web application that allows users to create and manage sticky notes and bulletin board posts. It demonstrates the use of Django, a Python web framework, to build a functional web application with a user interface. This aspect of coding is important as it combines both front-end and back-end development, which is necessary for full-stack development.
